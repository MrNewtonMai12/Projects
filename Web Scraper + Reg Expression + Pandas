<p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in
history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history
of our nation. </p>
<p>Five score years ago a great American in whose symbolic shadow
we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This
momentous decree came as a great beckoning light of hope to
millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of
withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long
night of their captivity. </p>
<p>But one hundred years later the Negro is still not free. One
hundred years later the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled
by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. </p>
<p>One hundred years later the Negro lives on a lonely island of
poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. </p>
<p>One hundred years later the Negro is still languishing in the
comers of American society and finds himself in exile in his own
land. </p>
<p>We all have come to this hallowed spot to remind America of
the fierce urgency of now. Now is the time to rise from the dark
and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial
justice. Now is the time to change racial injustice to the solid
rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice ring out for
all of God's children. </p>
<p>There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until
the Negro is granted citizenship rights. </p>
<p>We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of
dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to
degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise
to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul
force. </p>
<p>And the marvelous new militarism which has engulfed the Negro
community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for
many of our white brothers have evidenced by their presence here
today that they have come to realize that their destiny is part
of our destiny. </p>
<p>So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow
I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American
dream. </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live
out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be
self-evident; that all men are created equal." </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the
sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be
able to sit together at the table of brotherhood. </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a
state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the
heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom
and justice. </p>
<p>I have a dream that little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
but by the content of their character. </p>
<p>I have a dream today. </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious
racists, with its Governor having his lips dripping with the
words of interposition and nullification, one day right there in
Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join
hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and
brothers. </p>
<p>I have a dream today. </p>
<p>I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted,
every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places
plains, and the crooked places will be made straight, and before
the Lord will be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. </p>
<p>This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the
mount with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the
mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be
able to transform the genuine discords of our nation into a
beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be
able to work together, pray together; to struggle together, to go
to jail together, to stand up for freedom forever, )mowing that
we will be free one day. </p>
<p>And I say to you today my friends, let freedom ring. From the
prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire, let freedom ring. From the
mighty mountains of New York, let freedom ring. From the mighty
Alleghenies of Pennsylvania! </p>
<p>Let freedom ring from the snow capped Rockies of Colorado! </p>
<p>Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California! </p>
<p>But not only there; let freedom ring from the Stone Mountain
of Georgia! </p>
<p>Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain in Tennessee! </p>
<p>Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill in Mississippi.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring. </p>
<p>And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we
let it ring from every village and hamlet, from every state and
every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of
God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles,
Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in
the words of the old Negro spiritual, "Free at last! Free at
last! Thank God almighty, we're free at last!" </p>
